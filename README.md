This project is to analyze chicago Divvy bike dataset which has two tables:
stations table ( id, name, latitude, longitude, dock ) and trips table ( tripid, bikeid, tripduration, starttime, endtime, from station id, from_station_name, to_station id, to station name, usertype(customer/subscriber), birthyear, gender). 
Another dataset is temperature dataset.
